      <h4>MyStudyLife Quick Reference Guide</h4>
      <h3>May 30th, 2016</h3>
      <h2>Programs Used</h2>
      <ul> MadCap Flare/ Microsoft Word</ul>
      <div class="paracontain">
        <p>During one of my editing courses at university, we were assigned into groups to create a set of instructions for an organization-focused application. My group choose to work on MyStudyLife.
          <br><embed src="Documents/My%20Study%20Life%20Quick%20Ref2.pdf">
        </p>
        <br> For the final portion of our instructions we created a quick reference guide to go along with while we did a group presentation. The group was comprised of other Technical Communications majors, the website was easy to use but had many features
        that would go unnoticed that we found useful while attending university.
        <br>
        <p>
          The project involved: usability testing, content management, and extensive planning. Our guide was user-friendly and all of our participants were able to complete various tasks on MyStudyLife.

      <h4>Watch Strap Replacement DIY</h4>
      <h3>November 30th, 2016</h3>
      <h2>Programs Used</h2>
      <ul> Adobe Photoshop/ Microsoft Word/ MadCap Flare</ul>
      <div class="paracontain">
        <p> As a part of my instruction writing course we were tasked with creating a instruction manual of our choosing. I like to save money where I can so I chose to create a guide to replacing your wristwatch strap, as opposed to getting a new watch.
          <br>
          <embed src="img/HTML5 - Top Navigation.pdf" alt="">
         
          <br> The instructions were not too difficult to create, I had trouble with the pictures since I only had access to my cell phone and did what I could to make them appealing in Photoshop. I started with dissembling my strap, taking notes on key steps and then I wrote the steps out. With my instructions created I then began taking photographs of every step before compiling it all together in a MadCap Flare project file. </p>

      <h4>Light Studio instructions</h4>
      <h3>November 28th, 2016</h3>
      <h2>Programs Used</h2>
      <ul> Adobe Illustrator/ Microsoft Word</ul>
      <div class="paracontain">
        <p>As a part of my final for Tech Communications Editing we were to edit a set of instructions. The instructions were poorly written and in some places, dangerous.
          <br><embed class="lights" src="Documents/BryanJames_LSInstructionsfinalfinalfinal%20(1).pdf">
          <embed src="Documents/ProofreadingB%5E0A%20(1).pdf" alt="">
          <embed src="Documents/CopyeditB%5E0A%20(1).pdf" type="">
          <br> I received a copy of instructions from a light studio kit. The instructions were poorly made, difficult to understand, and full of misinformation. The revisions were made with a general English speaking consumer as the audience. This editing
          project demonstrates my skills and knowledge of copyediting, proofreading, and comprehensively editing a document. </p>

        <br> The set of instructions were poorly written and were in desperate need of revision. This was an individually assigned project that involved very little research beyond the products that were included in the instructions. I started by with
        markdown on the original, then I made a copyedited version and a proofread version. I then recreated the instructions on a new Word document with my revisions for total control of the document.

      <h4>First Tee Transportation Proposal</h4>
      <h3>June 3rd, 2015</h3>
      <h2>Programs Used</h2>
      <ul>Microsfot Word, Microsoft Excel</ul>
      <div class="paracontain">
       <br>
        <p>The First Tee of the Inland Northwest was working with my university to create a proposal to send to various foundations and charitable trusts to acquire funding. I was a part of a four-person group, our goal was to create a proposal focusing
          on finding the organization transportation.
          <br> <embed class="pdf" src="Documents/BJJT_Final_Proposal-1%20(1).pdf" type="">
          <br> We all worked on the project throughout, I mainly found myself writing content and researching foundations. I had found the organization that our letter targets in the proposal, they were probably the best shot at getting funding. The project’s
          success was contingent upon another group’s proposal getting funding. </p>
